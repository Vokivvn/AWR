 GER.1.t:0 "The Heartland of Socialism"
 GER.1.d:0 "Germany has been what many have considered to be the "Peacekeeper" of the world. After our victory in the Great Proletarian War, we have entered an era of peace and prosperity, not just from our own victories, but also from those of our allies. But despite all of this, there are some troubling reports. News from the USRR suggests they are trying to distance themselves from the Third Internationale. We fear that this could lead to a schism in international socialism and, in the worst-case scenario, another war. We are hopeful, however. Socialism has triumphed once before and shall again; the Great minds of Marx, Engels, Liebknecht, and Luxemburg have written this fact of history."
 GER.1.a:0 "Long Live the KPD!"
